# Music Bot
`Python` | `Discord`

`2022 March 31`

It's first music bot created by me. It's uses `youtube_dl` library to download videos
and `discord` library to play music from video.

## How to use
In `main.py` set`TOKEN` value to your bot's token, set `DEVELOPER_KEY` value to your GoogleApiClient DeveloperKey,
set `TEXT_CHANNEL_ID` to your text channel id in discord, `VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` to your voice channel id in discord.

Music bot have 2 commands:
- `> play <link>` play music from youtube video
- `> list <link>` play all musics from youtube playlist
